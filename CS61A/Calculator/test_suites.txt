-5 - (-7) → 2

-4 * 3 → -12

12 / -3 → -4

-2 ^ 3 → -8 (since (-2)^3)

-10 % 3 → -1 or 2 (depending on language conventions)

Decimals and Fractions:

2.5 + 3.1 → 5.6

7.5 - 2.3 → 5.2

3.6 * 2 → 7.2

5.5 / 2 → 2.75

Zero to the Power of Zero: 0 ^ 0 → Expected: Undefined or Error

Negative Exponentiation: 2 ^ -2 → 0.25

Modulo by Zero: 5 % 0 → Expected: Error message

Large Numbers: 1e10 * 1e10 → Test for overflow

Combinations and Order of Operations:

2 + 3 * 4 → Expected: 14 (ensure multiplication before addition)

(2 + 3) * 4 → Expected: 20 (if parentheses are supported)

6 / 2 * (1 + 2) → Expected: 9

2. Advanced Math Operators
Functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, asin, acos, atan, log, n-th root

Test Cases:

Trigonometric Functions (Assuming Radians):

sin(0) → 0

sin(π/2) → 1 (Use 3.1416 for π if necessary)

cos(0) → 1

cos(π) → -1

tan(0) → 0

tan(π/4) → 1

Cotangent:

cot(π/4) → 1

Note: cot(0) → Expected: Undefined or Error

Inverse Trigonometric Functions:

asin(1) → π/2 or 1.5708

acos(0) → π/2 or 1.5708

atan(1) → π/4 or 0.7854

Edge Cases:

asin(2) → Expected: Error (Domain is [-1,1])

acos(-2) → Expected: Error

Logarithms:

Natural Log: ln(e) → 1

ln(1) → 0

Base 10 Log: log(10) → 1

log(100) → 2

Edge Cases:

ln(0) → Expected: Undefined or Error

log(-1) → Expected: Error

n-th Root:

Square Root: √4 or nrt(4,2) → 2

Cube Root: nrt(27,3) → 3

Edge Cases:

Even Root of Negative Number: √(-4) → Expected: Error or Complex Number

Zero Root: nrt(8,0) → Expected: Undefined or Error

Domain and Range Checks:

Ensure functions handle inputs only within their valid domains.

Test periodicity and symmetry where applicable.

3. Constants Viewing
Constants: e, π

Test Cases:

Display e:

Expected: 2.718281828... (test the precision up to at least 10 decimal places)

Display π:

Expected: 3.1415926535... (test the precision)

Usage in Calculations:

e ^ 1 → Should return e

sin(π) → Should return approximately 0 (test for floating-point errors)

ln(e ^ 2) → Should return 2

4. History Functionality
Operations:

Viewing History:

Perform a series of calculations and then view history.

Expected: All previous computations are listed in order.

Deleting Computations:

Delete the last computation.

Expected: Last entry is removed from history.

Delete a specific computation (e.g., second computation).

Expected: Specific entry is removed; others remain intact.

Clear All History.

Expected: History is empty upon viewing.

Edge Cases:

Deleting from an empty history.

Expected: Appropriate message indicating history is empty.

Viewing history after restarting the program (if persistent storage is implemented).

Verify that history maintains correct sequence after deletions.

5. Menu Navigation and Interaction
Menus:

Main Menu Options:

Simple Operations

Math Operators

Constants

History

Exit

Test Cases:

Navigation:

Select each menu option and verify it leads to the correct submenu or action.

From each submenu, choose the Exit option.

Expected: Returns to Main Menu.

From Main Menu, select Exit.

Expected: Program terminates gracefully.

Invalid Inputs:

Inputting invalid menu choices (e.g., letters, numbers outside of option range).

Expected: Proper error message and prompt to re-enter choice.

Rapid Selections:

Quickly navigate through menus to test for stability.

Expected: No crashes or unexpected behavior.

6. Program Termination
Test Cases:

Exiting from Submenus:

Ensure that selecting Exit from any submenu returns to Main Menu every time.

Exiting from Main Menu:

Select Exit.

Expected: Program closes without errors.

Unexpected Shutdowns:

Force close the program during operation (if possible).

Expected: No corruption of data or settings upon restart.

Additional Testing Considerations
Input Validation:

Invalid Numeric Inputs:

Letters: Input a + b

Expected: Error message prompting for valid numbers.

Special Characters: Input @ + #

Expected: Same as above.

Function Inputs:

sin('abc') → Expected: Error indicating invalid input.

log('') → Expected: Error for empty input.

Boundary Values:

Maximum and minimum values supported by the calculator.

Expected: Correct calculations or appropriate error messages for overflows.

User Interface and Experience:

Clarity of Messages:

Ensure prompts are clear and instructive.

Error messages should inform the user of the exact issue and how to correct it.

Consistency:

Uniform format for displaying results.

Consistent terminology across menus and instructions.

Accessibility:

Test with different input methods if applicable (keyboard, touch).
