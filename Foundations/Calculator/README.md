<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
A simple command-line calculator built with Python. This calculator works as follows:
- When you run the program, it leads you to the main menu. The main menu prompts you with a list of 3 categories: simple mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, ^, %), advanced mathematical operations (trigonometric functions, log, and n-th root), and mathematical constants(e, pi)
- When you choose a category, it moves you to that session and provides you with a list of operations. You can choose a number to perform the corresponding operation. After performing 1 operation, you can choose to perform another one in the same session or exit to the main menu.
- The program terminates when you choose to exit in the main menu.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites
You should have git and python3 installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/earlybird3010/practice_projects/tree/main/Foundations/Calculator
   ```
2. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Implement simple operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- [x] Implement an exit option. This way, the program doesn't stop after performing 1 computation.
- [x] Error handling: handle division by 0 and invalid inputs
- [x] Advanced math operations: implement exponentiation, n-th root, log, trigonometric functions, etc.
- [ ] History management: Keep track of some previous calculations
- [ ] Equation solving: Try support for solving linear, quadratic, or even polynomial equations. What about matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, inversion, etc.? What about solving system of linear equations?
- [ ] Graphing capabilities: Plotting functions (matplotlib can help)
- [ ] Statistics: Add a session for basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.)
- [ ] Improved input enhancement: Users can directly type the expression to the console to obtain the result. Allow usage of parentheses
- [ ] Unit conversion: Add a feature for converting between different units (length, weight, volume, etc.)
- [ ] Scientific Notation and Precision Control: For very large and very small numbers, display the results in scientific notation. Allow the user to control the number of decimal places.
- [ ] User Interface: build a GUI to enhance interactivity
- [ ] Error Handling and Validation: cover most edge cases smoothly
- [ ] Settings and Customization: users are able to customize themes, number formats, and display settings, and save preferences for future sessions.
- [ ] User Profiles: Add the ability for users to save preferences or default values (e.g., set default units, constant values, etc.)
