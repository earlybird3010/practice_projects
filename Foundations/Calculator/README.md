<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
A simple command-line calculator built with Python. This calculator works as follows:
- When you execute the program, it prompts you with a list of options to choose from. Right now, there are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The number of variables required to execute an operation is constant. 
- After you choose an option, the program requires all variables necessary for the computation. When you provide all the variables, the program returns the computational result.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites
You should have git and python3 installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/earlybird3010/practice_projects/tree/main/Foundations/Calculator
   ```
2. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Implement simple operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- [x] Implement an exit option. This way, the program doesn't stop after performing 1 computation.
- [x] Error handling: handle division by 0 and invalid inputs
